# F-TED machine learning

## To get started
* Check out/download this repo.
* [Get docker](https://www.docker.com/products/overview)


## Activities
* Cats and dogs. This notebook will get you training a CNN to classify images either cat or dog. This requires the [Kaggle dogs v cats data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) sorted in to `data/train/dog`, `data/train/cat`, `data/validation/dog`, `data/validation/cat`. If your here for F-TED talk to Theo as I've got this on a USB to save time.
* RNN and word embedding - This is a look at using text as a data set and using the technique of embedding words in a high demential space. Sorry but these note books aren't tidy or curated well. Watcha!
* More: Decision trees, linear regression, and some other stuff. This wasn't originally designed for the notebook environment.



## Running
run `./run.sh` in a terminal with docker running. This will start Jypyter. Open the url that the script spits out.
Pick a note book and have fun!
